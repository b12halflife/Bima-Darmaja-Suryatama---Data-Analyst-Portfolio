Hi, I'm Bima! I have a background in Informatics Engineering and am currently on track to complete my degree at Universitas Pamulang. I have developed a strong foundation in life sciences and have a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

Project Portfolio:

Crime Data Analysis (2020 - Present)
code : https://github.com/b12halflife/Bima-Darmaja-Suryatama---Data-Analyst/tree/main/prediksi%20crime%20data

This project focused on analyzing a dataset of crimes in Los Angeles from 2020 to the present. The dataset included details on crime types, dates, and locations. The project involved loading, cleaning, and preprocessing the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between race, gender, and crime locations, and implementing Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

Skills: Data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy

Results: The analysis revealed that Hispanic, White, and Black individuals experienced the highest crime rates, with the most frequent crime locations being on streets.

Global Inflation Analysis in ASEAN and Indonesia
code : https://github.com/b12halflife/Bima-Darmaja-Suryatama---Data-Analyst/tree/main/prediksi%20ifnlasi%20asean

This project focused on the impact of inflation on the world, ASEAN, and Indonesia. The analysis included examining how events like COVID-19 affected the economy. Significant trends observed included a sharp increase in inflation in 2022, largely due to the global pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, which disrupted supply chains and increased energy prices.

Skills: Data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization

Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy

Results: The analysis showed how policies and leadership styles of presidents influenced inflation rates.

Indonesia's Population with Formal Basic Education and Education Gap

The chart in this project fcust on shows that Indonesia made substantial progress in reducing the number of out-of-school children, both male and female, particularly from 2000 to 2010 by 2%.

Skills: Data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization

Technology: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

Results: Indonesia showed considerable improvement in formal education between 1970 and 2000. However, from 2012 to the present, the number of out-of-school children remained higher compared to Malaysia, which consistently maintained low numbers throughout the period.
